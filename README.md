# Configuration of the HP33120A 15 MHz arbitrary function generator. Development of a communication library with an USB2GPIB mediator.

This library implements a way of configuring an HP3312A function generator by SCPI commands via a GPIB bus and a USB2GPIB Arduino UNO programmed as a mediator/conversor. This is an unfinished project. Complex commands such as sample sending tend to fail when using a large sample vector and no solution has been found by now.

Please note that the JupyterLab document is written in spanish.
